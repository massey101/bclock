# bclock

BClock is a Low powered alarm clock for Barrukka unpacked challenge. The idea
for the project came from when I wanted to move my phone alarm so that I would
have to get out of bed to turn it off, however, then I would be unable to
charge my phone at night.

Goals:
  * Battery powered with a long life (>1 month).
  * Loud enough to wake someone up.
  * No annoying lights that make it difficult to sleep.
  * Be cool

## Dependencies

  * avr-gcc
    - avr-binutils
  * avr-libc
  * avr-libc-doc
  * avrdude
    - libftdi
